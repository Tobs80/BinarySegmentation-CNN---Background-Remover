# BinarySegmentation-CNN---Background-Remover

You have to download the "87bs.hdf5" file from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sPZ0_FqQtDFiM3YhAYQ_euA9bS80xN6x/view?usp=sharing

Download it in the same folder than the test-model.py and run it. There are 2 binary masks one that is created by the CNN and another that is created by mediapipe. 
This is just so see how different the obtained binary mask is from a "Pro" binary mask.
